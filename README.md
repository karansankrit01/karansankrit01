Hi, I’m Karan Kumar Sankrit 👋 — a Computer Science student who sees coding as something that turns ideas into reality. 
Starting with a blank screen and shaping it into something that actually works ✨.

I’m always keen to explore how things work 🔍—in code, in systems, and in life as well. That curiosity keeps me learning new skills, experimenting with projects, and improving step by step.

My current toolkit includes Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, and Node.js and I keep sharpening my problem-solving through DSA and logic-building. What excites me most is connecting what I learn to real-world impact 🌍.

Open to internships and conversations 🤝 with curious minds who love building and learning.
